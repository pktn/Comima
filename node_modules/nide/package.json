  "readme": "nide\n====\n\n`nide` is a web-based IDE for node.js. It’s designed with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind.\n`nide` was initially developed as part of the Node Knockout 48 hour coding competition.\n\n`nide`’s current features:\n\n- Project tree display\n- File operations (create/delete/rename files and folders, hide/show hidden files)\n- Syntax highlighted code editing for multiple programming languages\n- OS X Lion-style automatic save\n- OS X Lion-style version management with revert and side-by-side editing features\n- Real time project tree filtering (using regular expressions)\n- NPM integration (display currently installed packages, add/remove packages, automatically update package.json)\n- Image previewing.\n- HTML previewing.\n- HTTP authentication (for running Nide on a public server)\n- Optionally run nide as a native Mac application.\n- Sleek interface reminiscent of TextMate\n- Node.JS Documentation browsing\n\nWhat's new in Nide 0.2.0:\n=========================\n\n- You can now refresh the directory listing manually, through the gear menu.\n- You can now specify a host IP for listening via a command line option.\n- You can now specify a username and password for HTTP authentication.\n- Editor state (caret position, selection, scroll) is now preserved when switching between multiple files.\n- Nide is now available as a native Mac application. The Mac app is still on a very early stage of development,\nso expect some hiccups.\n- Numerous bug fixes.\n\nWhat's new in Nide since 0.1.0 was released:\n============================================\n\n- Nide now supports syntax highlighting for filetypes other than JavaScript.\n- A simple cache mechanism is now present to avoid unnecessary directory listings.\n- Directory listing is now much faster and more reliable.\n- Nide is now able to launch the user's default browser from the command line\n- The client code has been almost completely refactored so it's now easier to mantain.\n- Nide will now check for file size before opening a file.\n- HTML files can now be previewed directly from Nide.\n- Image files can now be viewed directly from Nide.\n- Lots of bugfixes.\n\nInstructions\n============\n\nFirst, install nide with:\n\n    sudo npm install -g nide\n\nOn a new or existing directory, use the following command to setup a new nide project:\n\n    nide init\n\nThis command will setup a `.nide` directory, automatically add it to your `.npmignore`\nand `.gitignore` files, and start the `nide` server on port 8123. Fire up your web browser\nat `localhost:8123` to use nide. If a directory is already a nide project, you can run\nnide simply by using:\n\n    nide\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nNide is released under a **MIT License**:\n\n    Copyright (C) 2011 by Marco Aurélio\n    \n    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n    of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n    in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n    to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n    copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n    furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\n    all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n    \n    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
